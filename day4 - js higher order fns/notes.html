Filter, Sort, Map, and Reduce all loop over the data.

All four higher-order functions use a callback.

<!--  CALLBACKS-->
http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-callback-functions-and-use-them/
Callback: Derived from a programming paradigm known as functional programming. At a fundamental level, functional programming specifies the use of functions as arguments.

Callback 2: a.k.a. a higher-order function, is a function that is passed to another function as a parameter, and the callback function is called (or executed) inside the main function.

Consider this common use of a callback function in jQuery:

example 1: function() is the callback

$("#btn_1").click(function() {
  alert("Btn 1 Clicked");
});

example 2:
var friends = ["Mike", "Stacy", "Andy", "Rick"];

friends.forEach(function (eachName, index){
console.log(index + 1 + ". " + eachName); // 1. Mike, 2. Stacy, 3. Andy, 4. Rick
});

<!-- DIFFERENCES -->

--Filter only outputs what you want.

--Map outputs th ewhole thing, like a machine that changes things. However, when I've used it in React, you can use it just like a loop and map over a ton of data, only outputting what you want.

--Sort needs a compare callback (function(a,b) {}) so you can continually compare one item against another.
  **Defaults to alphabetically.
  ** For numbers, a - b ascending.
                  b - a descending.

--Reduce needs a running total (accumulator) and value (value for each item or index)
