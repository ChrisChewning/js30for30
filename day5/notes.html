FLEXBOX
Usual flexbox, I've learned is:

display: flex;
flex-direction: column or row or row-reverse
justify-content: flex-start, flex-end, etc.
align-items: center;

Now we've added the flex key in a child container and put 1 as a value. This
means evenly distribute the space.

example:

.panel {
  flex: 1; //if it's 5 it's 5x the width so you don't need to set a width property.
}


CSS SELECTORS
with selectors * is all  and :first-child or :last-child etc. You do not put spaces in b.w though.

.panel.open-active > *:first-child {
  transform: translateY(0);
}


EVENT LISTENERS

We used the 'click' and 'transitionend' listeners. They need to be in ''. Then the 2nd parameter is a function.


CLASSES

<!-- First, we selected everything with the class panel & destructured it into the variable panels. -->

const panels = document.querySelectorAll('.panel');


<!-- We looped over them, attaching an event listener & a fn.: -->
panels.forEach(panel => panel.addEventListener('click', toggleOpen));

<!-- we made functions. important: nowhere in the CSS is just 'open' or 'open-active.' Instead, you have panel.open.  -->


function toggleOpen(){ //initial open
  console.log('hi');
  this.classList.toggle('open')
}

function toggleActive(e){
  console.log(e.propertyName);
  if (e.propertyName.includes('flex')) {
    this.classList.toggle('open-active'); //points to .panel.open-active ?
  }
}
