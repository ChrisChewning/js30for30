transition
-transition has a lot of options. ease is the one we used, which is the default one if you don't specify ease. it goes slow then fast then ends slow. https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css3_transitions.asp  */

-other possible transition changes:
height: 2s,
width: 4s,
webkit-transition-delay: 1s; /* Safari */
transition-delay: 1s;

transforms move or change the appearance of an element,
transitions make the element smoothly and gradually change from one state to another.
