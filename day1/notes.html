<!-- JS

In vanilla js you can just put window.addEventListener. In React and node it's different. ex: handleChange = (e) => {}  or handleSubmit = (e) => {}

you also have document.querySelector() and document.querySelectorAll() and you used the .play() method on audio.

Logging out (e) is important b.c then you can do things based on the properties in the event.

Remember return stops the fn.

Lastly, an easy loop in vanilla js is just to say const <variable name> = document.querySelectorAll('.<class>' or '#<id>') then <name>.forEach ...

transition
-transition has a lot of options. ease is the one we used, which is the default one if you don't specify ease. it goes slow then fast then ends slow. https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css3_transitions.asp  */

-other possible transition changes:
height: 2s,
width: 4s,
webkit-transition-delay: 1s; /* Safari */
transition-delay: 1s,
transition-duation: 3s, /* how long it takes to transition to final stage but not back down. */
transition-timing: 2s, /*	Specifies the speed curve of the transition effect */



transforms move or change the appearance of an element,
transitions make the element smoothly and gradually change from one state to another.
